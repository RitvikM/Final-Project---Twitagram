Final Ruby on Rails project :

I talked to Matt and decided to change the idea which i proposed in the midterm.

This application is meant to be a cross of twitter and instagram, where users can post images and write a caption for each.
Users can add friends. Being friends is a one-way relationship, you don't need the other person to confirm the relationship to be friends with someone
Its a bit like follow. 

On the my Friends page you can see your own posts and the friends you have
On the All users page you can see a list of all the users who use the app and you can add them as friends

All basic features are complete. the only bug at the moment is the fact that you can add friends twice
which makes them appear on friends list more than once. If i had more time i would have implemented 
the ImageMagick gem to try and add filters to the images Instagram-style, but I couldnt figure it out. 

Thanks!
